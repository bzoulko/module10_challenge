# Module 10 Challenge Project - Object-Oriented Programming - Team Profile Generator
This program is a CLI application using node.js to run it. After starting the application your prompted to enter a team manager and several key features about the manager. Then a menu selection comes up asking you to add an Engineer to the team or an Intern or select Finished to exit. Selecting Finished will compile all team members added and finalize the index.html, then runs it in a new browser window for you to review.


## Key elements in the Team Profile Generator.
* Adding a Team <b>Manager</b>, you'll be prompted to enter the following:
    - Name          ( No Validation )
    - ID            ( Validated to all numerics. )
    - Email         ( Must formulate a valid Email address. )
    - Office Number ( Validated to all numerics. )

* Adding a Team <b>Engineer</b>, you'll be prompted to enter the following:
    - Name          ( No Validation )
    - ID            ( Validated to all numerics. )
    - Email         ( Must formulate a valid Email address. )
    - GitHub        ( No Validation )

* Adding an <b>Intern</b>, you'll be prompted to enter the following:
    - Name          ( No Validation )
    - ID            ( Validated to all numerics. )
    - Email         ( Must formulate a valid Email address. )
    - School        ( No Validation )

Upon entering these team members and the specs for each, some fields are validated and will not continue until you've entered the correct format. 


### Special Testing:
* Run testing at the terminal prompt by typing "npm test".

* Several tests will be performed on each class module to prove they work efficiently and effectivly.

* There will be 3 tests performed on the Employee's class, 4 tests on the
Manager's class, and 4 tests on the Intern's class. 

* The number of tests was determined by the number of arguments passed to each class module. Each argument must undergo an integrity test to ensure the data is not lost and logically the routine will not fail.


### Spoecial Notes:
* The index.js file contains a majority of the logic for this application.

* Class modules can be found under <b>lib</b>, which assist in gathering the necessary arguments for each type of team member.

* Test modules can be found under <b>_test_</b>, what help ensure each class modules effectiveness on the application requirements.

* Under <b>dist</b> there's a <b>reset.css</b> and <b>style.css</b> in order for the index.html, which is generated by the application, to  display all elements in the expected fashion per our module 10 challenge requirements.

* Under <b>src</b> there's the htmlTemplate module which supplies the application with a base for the Team Profiles before adding in team members.
